== Adding MicroProfile health checks

The application we have deployed depends on a Postgres database to persist data.  If the database becomes unavailable the application should detect this and stop receiving connections until it becomes avalailable again.

Let's test the current situation.  Go to the developer-ui and "Topology" view.

Click on the postgresql deployment, and goto the details tab.

image::scale-down-pg.png[]

Scale down the postgresql deeployment to zero pods by clicking on the image:scale-icon.png[] icon.

Wait for the deployment to scale down to zero and then try calling making a call to our application.

We'll need to refresh the ROUTE_NAME variable to allow us to make calls via curl.

====
Test the connection with the following:

[source]
----
curl http://$ROUTE_NAME/resources/developers

----

Since the application is unable to connect to the database, you should receive an error like:  

[source]
----
Internal Server Error
----

The problem is the application is still accepting connections.

Cloud native applications should be able to provide accurate health check responses.

In the case of our application, we can check for a valid database connection as part of health check.

JBoss EAP XP and MicroProfile allows us to simply add a custom health check which will check the database connection.

To do this, we need to make 2 minor changes to our application source code.

* Addition of DBConnectionHealthCheck.java

[source, java]
----
package org.wildfly.demo;

import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.HealthCheck;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.HealthCheckResponse;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.Readiness;

import javax.persistence.EntityManager;
import javax.persistence.PersistenceContext;

@Readiness
public class DBConnectionHealthCheck implements HealthCheck {
    private static final String HC_NAME = DBConnectionHealthCheck.class.getSimpleName();

    @PersistenceContext
    EntityManager em;

    @Override
    public HealthCheckResponse call() {
        try {
            em.createNativeQuery("SELECT 1").getSingleResult();
            return HealthCheckResponse.up(HC_NAME);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            return HealthCheckResponse.builder()
                    .name(HC_NAME)
                    .down()
                    .withData("Data Base Server is not available", e.toString())
                    .build();
        }
    }
}
----

* Addition of the microprofile-health-api dependency to pom.xml

[source, xml]
----
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.eclipse.microprofile.health</groupId>
            <artifactId>microprofile-health-api</artifactId>
            <version>3.0</version>
            <scope>provided</scope>
        </dependency>
----

We've made these changes already in our source code reepository in the main branch. We'll need to rebuild our JBoss EAP image using the EAP XP4 helm chart.

== Building a MicroProfile application image.

We're going to replace the JBoss EAP helm chart with an "EAP XP4" helm chart.  Do do this we'll delete the existing helm chart and create a new one.

Using the developer-ui, navigate to "Helm" and click on the extended menu option for the "eap74" helm chart.

image::delete-helm.png[]

Click on "Uninstall helm release" and then enter the name of the helm chart, "eap74"

image::confirm-delete.png[]

Click on uninstall.

Next, click on "+Add" and select "Helm Chart"

image::select-eapxp4.png[]

Select "Eap Xp4" and then click on "Install Helm Chart"

image::install-eapxp4.png[]

Change the "Release Name" field to "eap74", this will allow our existing Operator deployment to deploy this new image.

Select "yaml view" and paste the following

[source, yaml]
----
image:
  tag: latest
  name: eap74
build:
  enabled: true
  mode: s2i
  env:
    - name: CUSTOM_INSTALL_DIRECTORIES
      value: extensions
  output:
    kind: ImageStreamTag
  s2i:
    jdk: '11'
    jdk11:
      builderImage: registry.redhat.io/jboss-eap-7/eap-xp4-openjdk11-openshift-rhel8
      runtimeImage: registry.redhat.io/jboss-eap-7/eap-xp4-openjdk11-runtime-openshift-rhel8
    version: latest
  bootableJar:
    builderImage: 'registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/openjdk-11:latest'
  uri: 'https://github.com/deewhyweb/wildfly-s2i-db.git'
  ref: main
deploy:
  enabled: false
----

image::eapxp-install-helm.png[]

Click on "Install"

Once the builds are complete the JBoss EAP operator will deploy a new instance of the application, because the image stream has been updated.  

Wait for the new instance to be deployed.  We can now test our new health check by scaling down the postgres database again.

== Testing MicroProfile health implementation

Go to the developer-ui and "Topology" view.

Click on the postgresql deployment, and goto the details tab.

image::scale-down-pg.png[]

Scale down the postgresql deeployment to zero pods by clicking on the image:scale-icon.png[] icon.

Wait for the deployment to scale down to zero.

After a short interval you'll notice the EAP deployment (example) is now showing 0 of 1 pods ready

image::eap-not-ready.png[]

This shows the health check we've deployed has now detected the postgres database is unavailable.  This instance of EAP will no longer accepts connections.  

If we curl the route e.g.

[source]
----
curl http://$ROUTE_NAME/resources/developers

----

We should get an immediate response showing the application is unailable.

If we scale the postgres database back to 1 replica, the EAP application should recover and start to accepts connections again.

== summary

In this section we've seen how simple it is to implement a kubernetes compatible health check using MicroProfile health.  With some minor code changes we've introduce an application specific health check using cloud native development techniques.

In the next section we'll look at how we can use EAP XP content-trimming to reduce image size and resource usage.
