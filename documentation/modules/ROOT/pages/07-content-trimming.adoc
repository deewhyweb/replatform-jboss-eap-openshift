== Using capability trimming to reduce image size

When building an image that includes JBoss EAP, you can control the JBoss EAP features and subsystems to include in the image.

The default JBoss EAP server included in S2I images includes the complete server and all features. You might want to trim the capabilities included in the provisioned server. For example, you might want to reduce the security exposure of the provisioned server, or you might want to reduce the memory footprint so it is more appropriate for a microservice container.

For more information on the layers available checkout the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_enterprise_application_platform/7.4/html/getting_started_with_jboss_eap_for_openshift_container_platform/capability-trimming-eap-foropenshift_default [documentation]

In this section we're going to use EAP XP capability trimming to reduce our application image size.

Before we start, we're going to take a baseline of the current image size.

Looking at the current image size, we should see something like 660mb

== Implement capability trimming

Our application provides a simple RestFul API, to provide this implementation our JBoss EAP deployment will need to include jax-rs libraries.  Our application also uses MicroProfile health, so these libraries are also required.

Looking at the list of layers available from EAP XP, we will need to include:

* jaxrs-server
* observability

To make this change to our application build process we can upgrade the helm chart with the addition of the following to the s2i block.

[source, yaml]
----
    galleonLayers:
      - jaxrs-server
      - observability

----

Using the developer-ui, navigate to "Helm" and click on the extended menu option for the "eap74" helm chart. Select upgrade and replace the yaml with the following.

[source, yaml]
----
build:
  bootableJar:
    builderImage: 'registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/openjdk-11:latest'
  enabled: true
  env:
    - name: CUSTOM_INSTALL_DIRECTORIES
      value: extensions
  mode: s2i
  output:
    kind: ImageStreamTag
  ref: main
  s2i:
    jdk: '11'
    galleonLayers:
      - jaxrs-server
      - observability
    jdk11:
      builderImage: registry.redhat.io/jboss-eap-7/eap-xp4-openjdk11-openshift-rhel8
      runtimeImage: registry.redhat.io/jboss-eap-7/eap-xp4-openjdk11-runtime-openshift-rhel8
    version: latest
  uri: 'https://github.com/deewhyweb/wildfly-s2i-db.git'
deploy:
  enabled: false
  route:
    enabled: true
    tls:
      enabled: true
      insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy: Redirect
      termination: edge
image:
  tag: latest

----

Next, goto builds and select "eap74-build-artifacts".

image::builds.png[]

Click on "Actions" -> "Start build"

image::start-build.png[]

This will kick off a new artifact build which in turn will trigger a new runtime build which will eventually trigger a new deployment of the application by the operator.  

Once the new image is deployed, check the image size:

image::eap-galleon-image-size.png[]

You should see the image size has dropped significantly to around 427mb, that's a reduction of 35%.  

In addition to this reduced image size we have also reduced the potential attack surface of the appliation making it more secure.

== summary

In this section we've reduced our application image size and attack surface with the simple addition of galleonLayers instruction to our helm chart.  
In the next section we'll look at how to implement observability with MicroProfile.
