== What's next?

In this tutorial we've looked at how to build and deploy JBoss EAP applications on OpenShift.  We've also introduced some cloud native techniques to implement intelligent health checks and monitoring and integrate with OpenShift tooling.

This is only the first step towards modern cloud native development.  

In addition to health checks and metrics, MicroProfile includes functionality for a range of cloud native techniques such as:

** Open Tracing
** OpenAPI
** Rest Client
** Config
** JAX-RS
** Fault Tolerance
** JWT Authentication

Having your applications deployed on OpenShift opens up many additional possibilties such as integration with Service Mesh and CICD depeloymnt with Tekton and ArgoCD.
