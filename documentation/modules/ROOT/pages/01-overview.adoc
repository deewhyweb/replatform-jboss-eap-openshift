[#overview]
== Overview of JBoss EAP on OpenShift

OpenShift is an ideal platform to host JBoss EAP applications.  Red Hat have developed a lot of features and tools for both JBoss EAP and OpenShift to ensure JBoss EAP workloads benefit from the functionality present in OpenShift.

[#benefits]
== Benefits of running JBoss EAP workloads on OpenShift

Some of the main benefits of running JBoss EAP workloads on OpenShift are:

* Lower operational costs, through streamlined configuration deployment and management
* Reduced resource usage, benefits of increased app density (via kubernetes bin packing) and reduced memory footprint as a result of layer trimming
* Improved developer experience, OpenShift provides developer-centric interface and tools

[#cloud-native]
== Cloud native development
Replatforming JBoss EAP applications on OpenShift opens up opportunities for cloud native development.  Simply re-platforming a JBoss EAP application to OpenShift will enable integration with cloud native tooling inherent in OpenShift such as disposability, concurrency, observability, and more.  

[#modernization]
== Application modernization
The addition of JBoss EAP XP adds additional modernization opportunities for your applications.  Such as:

* Microprofile support i.e.
** Open Tracing
** OpenAPI
** Rest Client
** Config
** JAX-RS
** Health Checks
** Fault Tolerance
** Metrics
** JWT Authentication
* capability trimming, enabling you to reduce the size of your application
* Bootable JAR support, enabling you to deploy your application as a JAR file


[#deployment]
== Deployment
OpenShift provides multiple options to deploy JBoss EAP applications.

* Template, providing options to build and deploy JBoss EAP applications
* Helm Chart, providing options to build and deploy JBoss EAP applications
* Operator, deploy only.  The operator is our recommended way to deploy JBoss EAP applications, including support for transaction completion and EJB remoting via static hostnames.


[#build-deploy]
== Building applications on OpenShift
OpenShift provides Source to Image (S2I) tooling to build JBoss EAP application images.  These images contain a runtime instance of JBoss EAP with all of the required dependencies and configuration, plus the application deployed. 

The JBoss EAP S2I tool performs the following steps:

image::s2i.png[] 

The resulting image benefits from reduced image size by creating a runtime image which does not require the tools required to build the application.

[#clustering]
== Clustering JBoss EAP applications on OpenShift
Clustering support for JBoss EAP clusters is enabled by configuring the JGroups protocol stack to use either kubernetes.KUBE_PING or dns.DNS_PING. By default the JBoss EAP Operator will use kubernetes.KUBE_PING.


[#autoscaling]
== Autoscaling applications
Re-platforming JBoss EAP applications on OpenShift opens up the ability to use kubernetes auto-scaling functionality to add instances of JBoss EAP application pods based on resource consumption, for example when a pod has consumed > 60% of memory allocated to it.

[#graceful-shutdown]
== Graceful shutdown

The JBoss EAP Operator enables safe transaction recovery in your application cluster by verifying all transactions are completed before scaling down the replicas and marking a pod as clean for termination

[#https]
== HTTPS configuration

The JBoss EAP Operator enables the configuration of HTTPS connection via the following environment variables.

* HTTPS_NAME
* HTTPS_PASSWORD
* HTTPS_KEYSTORE

[#platform-options]
== OpenShift platform options
There are a number of ways the OpenShift platform can deployed and consumed, depending on the requirements and location.  OpenShift can be deployed self managed on internal infrastructure, self managed on cloud infrastructure, or consumed as a fully managed service from Red Hat and cloud provider e.g. Azure Red Hat Openshift (ARO) or Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA).
