== Deploying applications with the JBoss EAP Operator

As we've seen from the previous sections the Helm chart will create the required objects to build and deploy JBoss EAP applications.  An alternate approach is to use thee Helm chart to perform the build only and the JBoss EAP operator to deploy the applicatioon.
The JBoss EAP operator is an ideal way to deploy JBoss EAP applications on OpenShift.  The operator provides the following benefits.

* Deploys the application using stateful sets ensuring static hostnames
* Ability to manage multiple JBoss EAP applications
* Enables transaction recovery with safe shutdown.

First we'll remove the deployment option from the Helm chart we created in the last section.  To do this, edit the eap74 helm chart and replace the yaml with the following

[source,yaml]
----
build:
  enabled: true
  env:
    - name: CUSTOM_INSTALL_DIRECTORIES
      value: extensions
  mode: s2i
  output:
    kind: ImageStreamTag
  ref: legacy
  s2i:
    amd64:
      jdk11:
        builderImage: registry.redhat.io/jboss-eap-7/eap74-openjdk11-openshift-rhel8
        runtimeImage: registry.redhat.io/jboss-eap-7/eap74-openjdk11-runtime-openshift-rhel8
      jdk8:
        builderImage: registry.redhat.io/jboss-eap-7/eap74-openjdk8-openshift-rhel7
        runtimeImage: registry.redhat.io/jboss-eap-7/eap74-openjdk8-runtime-openshift-rhel7
    arch: amd64
    galleonLayers:
      - jaxrs-server
    jdk: '11'
    version: latest
  uri: 'https://github.com/deewhyweb/wildfly-s2i-db.git'
deploy:
  enabled: false
image:
  tag: latest
----

This will disable the deployment and remove the deployment artifacts created by the helm chart.  We'll now use the JBoss EAP Operator to deploy the image.

[#install]
== Install the JBoss EAP Operator.

Operators need to be installed by a user with the cluster admin role.  Login to OpenShift as a cluster admin and navigate to Operators -> Operator hub.

Enter "EAP" in the "Filter by keyword" box.  Select the "JBoss EAP" operator.

Click on "Install"

Leave the default options unchanged and click on "Install" to make the operator available for all namespaces.

After a few minutes the JBoss EAP operator will be deployed and ready to use.

Now that the JBoss EAP operator is installed we can switch back to the developer-ui, all remaining tasks can be completed without cluster admin rights.

[#deploy]
== Deploy JBoss EAP application with the operator

Switch back to the developer-ui and click on "+Add" to add a new application.

Select "Operator Backed"

You should see the "Wildfly server" option

Click on "Wildfly server"

Click on Create and switch to "Yaml view"

Paste the following yaml to configure the deployment

[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: wildfly.org/v1alpha1
kind: WildFlyServer
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  applicationImage: 'eap74:latest'
  env:
    - name: TEST_DATABASE
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          key: database-name
          name: postgresql
    - name: TEST_PASSWORD
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          key: database-password
          name: postgresql
    - name: TEST_USERNAME
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          key: database-user
          name: postgresql
    - name: DATASOURCES
      value: TEST
    - name: TEST_DRIVER
      value: postgresql
    - name: TEST_JNDI
      value: 'java:/jdbc/postgresql'
    - name: TEST_NAME
      value: postgresql
    - name: TEST_URL
      value: 'jdbc:postgresql://postgresql:5432/demodb'
    - name: TEST_NONXA
      value: 'true'
  replicas: 1
----

Click on "Create" to start the deployment.

You will be taken to the topology view

image::operator-topology.png[]

You'll see from the topology a number of objects where created by the wildfly server custom resource.  

Once the pod has completed start-up, click on image:open-url.png[] to view the application's landing page.

== Summary

We've successfully completed the deployment of our application with the JBoss EAP operator.  Next we'll look at how to make our application more container-native with JBoss EAP XP (expansion pack)
